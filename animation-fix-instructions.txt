# Animation & Carousel Fix Instructions

Your HTML file has a serious structural issue that's breaking JavaScript functionality. There's a duplicate HTML document embedded inside the JavaScript code, specifically starting at line 3714 where the `handleSwipe()` function is cut off.

## The Problem

The file has over 200 linter errors because there's an unexpected `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag inside a JavaScript function. This structure break is corrupting the entire file and preventing proper execution of all animations and carousel functionality.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Remove all broken JavaScript from anjalididi.html

1. Open anjalididi.html in a code editor
2. Locate the problematic script section around line 3595 (search for "Carousel Functionality")
3. Remove this entire broken script section, including the duplicate HTML document that follows it

### Step 2: Add the new animation-fix.js file

1. Make sure the animation-fix.js file is in the same directory as your HTML file
2. Add this line just before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="animation-fix.js"></script>
```

## What the Fix Provides

The new animation-fix.js file includes:

1. **Hero Slider Animation**
   - Auto-advancing slides with proper transitions
   - Touch swipe support for mobile users
   - Dot navigation support

2. **Scroll Animations**
   - Elements with the `.animate-on-scroll` class will animate as they enter the viewport
   - Support for staggered children animations

3. **Carousel Functionality**
   - Complete implementation for all carousels (products, principles, plants, testimonials)
   - Responsive layout adjusting slides per view based on screen size
   - Touch support for mobile devices
   - Navigation arrows and dot indicators
   - Visual feedback for disabled navigation states

4. **Ayurvedic Elements Animation**
   - Subtle, randomized movements for decorative elements
   - Creates a more dynamic, alive feel for the page

5. **Mobile Menu**
   - Proper toggle functionality for mobile menu
   - Auto-closing when links are clicked

6. **Smooth Scrolling**
   - Proper anchor link behavior with header offset
   - Smooth animation when navigating between sections

7. **Lazy Loading**
   - Performance optimization for images
   - Images load only when they enter the viewport
   - Fallback for older browsers

## Troubleshooting

If animations still don't work after implementing these changes:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that class names in your HTML match those referenced in the JavaScript
3. Ensure the animation-fix.js file is correctly loaded (no 404 errors)
4. For hero slider, make sure your slides have the class `.slide`
5. For scroll animations, ensure elements have `.animate-on-scroll` class
6. For carousels, check that your carousel structure uses the expected class names
