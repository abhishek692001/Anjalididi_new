## Carousel Functionality Fix

### Issue Identified
The main HTML file (anjalididi.html) has a corrupted structure with a duplicate HTML document embedded within the JavaScript code. Specifically, the carousel functionality is broken because the `handleSwipe()` function is cut off by an unexpected `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag at line 3714.

### How to Fix

1. **Option 1: Use the separate carousel-fix.js file**
   - Include the carousel-fix.js file at the end of your HTML body:
   ```html
   <script src="carousel-fix.js"></script>
   ```
   - Remove the broken carousel code from anjalididi.html (lines ~3595-3715)

2. **Option 2: Fix the inline JavaScript**
   - Locate the broken handleSwipe function around line 3714
   - Replace it with the complete implementation:
   ```javascript
   function handleSwipe() {
       const difference = touchStartX - touchEndX;
       // Threshold for swipe detection - 50px
       if (Math.abs(difference) > 50) {
           if (difference > 0) {
               // Swipe left - go to next slide
               goToSlide(currentIndex + 1);
           } else {
               // Swipe right - go to previous slide
               goToSlide(currentIndex - 1);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - Make sure to properly close all script tags and remove the duplicate HTML document

### Full Functionality
The fixed carousel implementation provides:
- Responsive slides based on screen size
- Touch swipe support for mobile devices
- Dot navigation for direct slide access
- Next/previous button navigation
- Visual feedback for navigation state

### Additional Recommendations
Consider using a code editor with syntax highlighting to help identify structural issues in your HTML file. The current file appears to have a duplicate HTML document that should be removed.
